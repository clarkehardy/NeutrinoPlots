# constants required for calculating effective Majorana mass:
g_A: 1.27 # axial-vector coupling constant
G_0v: 14.58e-15 # phase space factor in years^-1
M_0v: 1.49 # nuclear matrix element

# mean and error of the parameters (from 2023 PDG assuming normal ordering)
theta_12: [33.41,0.75] # 1-2 mixing angle in degrees
theta_13: [8.54,0.12] # 1-3 mixing angle in degrees
delta_m2_21: [7.41e-5,0.21e-5] # 2-1 mass-squared difference in eV^2
delta_m2_23: [-2.437e-3,0.28e-3] # 2-3 mass-squared difference in eV^2
